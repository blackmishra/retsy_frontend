    "description": "11 Tigers is a speakeasy to know should you be out drinking in the East Village. Not only for its yadong-infused cocktails (a reputed Thai herbal liqueur), but for its exciting izakaya menu, where the cuisines of Japan and Thailand collide to delicious effect — think tom yum ramen, drunken (udon) noodles, and the like.
